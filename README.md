# Emotionally-Intelligent-AI-based-movie-dubbing
Problem Statement: AI to seamlessly translate and dub content into any language while preserving the original speaker's emotions, characteristics, and authenticity.


## Description

This AI-based dubbing project aims to make global content more accessible by translating videos into different languages while retaining the original speaker's unique qualitiesâ€”like age, gender, and accent. Most importantly, it keeps the speaker's emotions and sentiments intact, so the experience feels just as genuine and relatable. The outcome ensures that it feels like the speaker is still the same, now just speaking in your native language, bringing the full depth of the original performance to a broader audience without losing its emotional impact.

### Steps to Achieve Emotionally Accurate AI-Based Dubbing:

Extract Emotion from Original Audio: Analyze the original speaker's voice to detect and classify emotions and sentiments conveyed in each segment of the speech. Translate and Preserve Speaker Characteristics: Convert the original speech into the target language while retaining unique attributes like age, gender, and accent to maintain the speaker's identity. Generate Emotion-Matched Voice: Synthesize the translated speech using a custom neural voice model that replicates the original speaker's emotional expression. Lip Sync with Video: Align the new audio with the original video to match lip movements, ensuring a natural and seamless viewing experience. Enhance Audio Quality: Remove noise, reduce hissing, and improve clarity to deliver professional-grade sound. Deploy and Optimize: Continuously refine the model through feedback loops to enhance emotion recognition, voice fidelity, and synchronization accuracy. These steps ensure the dubbed content not only speaks in a new language but also captures the full emotional depth and authenticity of the original performance.
